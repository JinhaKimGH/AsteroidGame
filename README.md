NOTE:

MYSQL DATABASE MUST FIRST BE CREATED
NAME OF DATABASE + PASSWORD OF MYSQL MUST BE CHANGED IN THE CONNECT FUNCTION

IN LINE 77, sql = "INSERT into score(name, score) VALUES (%s, %s)", make sure to replace the score outside of the brackets with your own table name.

The game is pretty awful, but the mysql database stuff is pretty cool.
